Description: Fast standalone full-text SQL search engine
 Sphinx is a standalone full text search engine, meant to provide fast, 
 size-efficient and relevant fulltext search functions to other applications. 
 Sphinx was specially designed to integrate well with SQL databases and 
 scripting languages. Currently built-in data sources support fetching data 
 either via direct connection to MySQL or PostgreSQL, or using XML pipe 
 mechanism (a pipe to indexer in special XML-based format which Sphinx 
 recognizes).
 .
 Sphinx is an acronym which is officially decoded as SQL Phrase Index.
